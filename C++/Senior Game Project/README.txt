Downloading the EXE:
-For best results, download the entire repository with the "Download zip" button. 
The EXE needs to be in a folder with all of the files(except the readme and SourceCode
folder) in the folder anyway, and I have had problems with downloading the EXE directly

Basic Controls:
*Press Tab to target a nearby enemy
*Press R to shoot at the enemy
*Press ESC to pause and bring up menu

For more specific information on controls,
go to the controls page from either of the menus
