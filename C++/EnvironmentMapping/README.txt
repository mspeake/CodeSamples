Downloading the EXE:
-For best results, download the entire repository with the "Download zip" button. 
The EXE needs to be in a folder with all of the files(except the readme and SourceCode
folder) in the folder anyway, and I have had problems with downloading the EXE directly

Controls:
*Press W to move forward
*Press S to move backward
*Press A to move left
*Press D to move right
*Press Spacebar to move up
*Hold left mouse button and move mouse to adjust camera direction

Use the GUI to select between reflection and refraction.
It also has an option to add normal mapping to the center object,
and 3 different shapes to choose from for the center object
