Downloading the EXE:
-For best results, download the entire repository with the "Download zip" button. 
The EXE needs to be in a folder with all of the files(except the readme and SourceCode
folder) in the folder anyway, and I have had problems with downloading the EXE directly

   plane, cube, cone, cylinder, and torus)
